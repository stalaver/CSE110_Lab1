## About Me
My name is Sergio Talavera. I am a first generation Peruvian-American born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. I am a second year Computer Engineering Transfer student here at UCSD. Some of my hobbies and things I like to do in my free time include hiking, cooking, snowboarding, skateboarding, surfing, going to concerts, watching movies, and trying new foods. I like a wide variety of music, but my three favorite artists/bands are Isaiah Rashad, The Strokes, and Danny Brown. I began programming in 2016 when I decided to give it a try in an Intro to Computer Science course at community college, and found an interest from there. I currently am scheduled to graduate in Winter 2022 and will be pursuing career opportunities following graduation. In the future, I hope to get the opportunity to participate in a Graduate Program, but as of right now I am interested in exploring subfields of Computer Science and Programming to see what kind of specific career path as a programmer I would enjoy.

A quote that I always keep with me:
> To know and to think we know not, is the crown. Not to know, and to think we know, is the affliction.

For good luck:
```
System.out.println("Hello World!");
```
